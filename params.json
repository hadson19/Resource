{"name":"Resource","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Hadson list of Publications.\r\n\r\n## [Six Revisions](http://sixrevisions.com/)\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t call Six Revisions a classical web development blog anymore, rather than a major news site for developers. Six Revisions publishes practical and useful articles for web developers and designers as well. Articles are published on a regular basis every 2-5 days.\r\n\r\n![Site SCREEN IMG](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/80fe5bd112a0954f462c3c66aef7f6d77895a034/687474703a2f2f647336627238663571703175322e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f626c6f672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031352f30332f315f7369787265766973696f6e732d626c6f672e706e673f373436653631)\r\n\r\n## [Specky Boy](http://speckyboy.com/)\r\n\r\nThe Specky Boy blog calls itself a design magazine. Paul Andrew – the publisher of Specky Bloy – not only focuses on design resources, but also provides useful insights on the latest web technologies. Especially for front-end developers the blog is definitely a great source for staying up-to-date.\r\n\r\n![Site SCREEN IMG](http://ds6br8f5qp1u2.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2_speckyboy.png?746e61)\r\n\r\n\r\n## [WebResourcesDepot](http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/) \r\n\r\nWebResourcesDepot is a great web development blog offering new posts every day.

It publishes great news articles, tips and resources on a variety of JavaScript frameworks and modules.
